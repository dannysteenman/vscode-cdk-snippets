## New

- Added support for [Gitpod](https://github.com/dannysteenman/vscode-cloudformation-snippets/issues/14) by publishing this extension to the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/dsteenman/cdk-snippets)

## Features

1. Supports all resources that are defined by CloudFormation in the form of L1 constructs in CDK
2. Triggers autocomplete by invoking `l1-<cloudformation-resource>`
3. The construct snippets are automatically updated every week after AWS updates their [CloudFormation Resource Specification.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-resource-specification.html)
4. Has builtin support for placeholders. This means you can quickly jump from property to property in each resource by using `Tab`
5. The extension will show which property is required by adding a ```// required``` comment next to it.
6. The autocomplete prompt shows the matching CDK resource documentation URL in its description.

## Usage

* **Step 1.** Install [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dannysteenman.cdk-snippets)
* **Step 2.** Start working in your CDK project (TypeScript)
* **Step 3.** Start adding L1 constructs in your code by using their prefix name e.g. ```l1-s3-bucket``` equals to L1 construct ```s3.CfnBucket```

> **Note:** Once you start typing a prefix (explained in step 3), the corresponding snippet shows up in the dropdown menu. If this doesn't happen automatically, press `ctrl + space` to invoke IntelliSense and search for the prefix of the resource type that you want to add (as listed in step 3).
