4. **Placeholder Support**: Navigate efficiently through resource properties using the `Tab` key, thanks to built-in placeholder functionality.
5. **Required Property Highlighting**: Easily identify mandatory properties, highlighted with a `// required` comment for your convenience.
6. **Documentation at Your Fingertips**: Access the corresponding CDK resource documentation directly from the autocomplete prompt, enriching your development experience.

## Usage

* **Step 1.** Install [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dannysteenman.cdk-snippets)
* **Step 2.** Start working in your CDK project (TypeScript)
* **Step 3.** Start adding L1 constructs in your code by using their prefix name e.g. ```l1-s3-bucket``` equals to L1 construct ```s3.CfnBucket```

> **Note:** Once you start typing a prefix (explained in step 3), the corresponding snippet shows up in the dropdown menu. If this doesn't happen automatically, press `ctrl + space` to invoke IntelliSense and search for the prefix of the resource type that you want to add (as listed in step 3).
